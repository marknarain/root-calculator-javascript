Root calculator
===
By Mark Narain Enzinger

## Overview
---

This root claculator uses the [Shifting nth root algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifting_nth_root_algorithm) to calculate the square root of a number by calculating each of its decimal places one after the other. 

This calculator can calculate up to 28 digits of a square root. The Number is limited, because of certain values, which grow and become bigger than a MaxSafeInt. 

This program has also been written in Python.
